- transfer: transfers the ownership of a NFT from the owner to a new owner (may need some sort of approval process first)

- collect: accepts an NFT in exchange for Shares of the DAO, the NFT needs to be supported/allowed by the DAO

- balanceOf: checks how many NFTs a given member holds? (or checks how many shares a member holds)?

- additional functions:

  - register potential new NFT vs register potential new internal NFT (double check the main difference)
  - get prior amount + create amount checkpoint (do we need that?)

- ERC721
  - onboarding for nft
